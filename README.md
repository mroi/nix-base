Lightweight Declarative Nix System Base
=======================================

This repostitory provides a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) flake for lightweight declarative 
system configuration. Different from the real NixOS, it is meant to realize its 
configuration on top of an underlying macOS or Linux installation.

The main entry point is the `rebuild` script. It manifests the configuration of the current 
host within the underlying system. To set up a brand new machine, it is sufficient to 
download this repository, create a configuration, and run `rebuild`.

The standard `rebuild` run is intended to be idempotent and reduces to a no-op on subsequent 
executions. The option `--update` or `-u` pulls external sources for package updates. 
Sub-categories can be enabled individually using `--update-<category>`.

The flake outputs are driven by subdirectories in this repository:

**[`machines`](/machines)**  
Declarative configurations for individual machines, organized by hostname.

**[`modules`](/modules)**  
NixOS-style configuration modules that are composed to form a final configuration.

**[`packages`](/packages)**  
Custom package declarations. Some are meant for direct consumption by end users and are 
included in the flakeâ€™s output. Others are only used internally by `rebuild`, for example to 
install macOS applications in `/Applications`.

**[`templates`](/templates)**  
Nix flake templates.
