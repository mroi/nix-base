Lightweight Declarative Nix System Base
=======================================

This repostitory provides a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) flake for lightweight declarative 
system configuration and maintenance. Different from the real NixOS, it is meant to realize 
its configuration on top of an underlying macOS or Linux installation.

The main entry point is the `rebuild` script. It manifests the configuration of the current 
host within the underlying system. To set up a brand new machine, it is sufficient to 
download this repository, create a configuration, and run `rebuild`.

The `rebuild` script supports a series of commands as arguments, which can be enumerated 
with the command line option `-h` or `--help`:

**`activate`**  
This is the default when no commands are given. It manifests the configuration on the host 
and is intended to be idempotent, reducing to a no-op on subsequent executions.

**`update`**  
Updates the whole system by pulling external sources. As these external sources can change 
it is not idempotent and should be rerun regularly.

**`clean`**  
Run regular maintenance tasks to check and clean the system. These are long-running tasks 
that may require considerable user interaction.

**`all`**  
Runs all the above commands.

The command line option `-i` or `--interactive` prompts for any state-changing commands.
Confirm them by pressing `Enter`.

Repository Structure
--------------------

The flake outputs are driven by subdirectories in this repository:

**[`machines`](/machines)**  
Declarative configurations for individual machines, organized by hostname.

**[`modules`](/modules)**  
NixOS-style configuration modules that are composed to form a final configuration.

**[`packages`](/packages)**  
Custom package declarations. Some are meant for direct consumption by end users and are 
included in the flakeâ€™s output. Others are only used internally by `rebuild`, for example to 
install macOS applications in `/Applications`.

**[`templates`](/templates)**  
Nix flake templates.
